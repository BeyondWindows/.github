# Beyond Windows

## Introduction

Beyond Windows is a project to hopefully bring massive change to the Windows Operating System

The plan to achieve this is simple. Convert enough people away from Windows to pressure microsoft to do something. If there was a big enough exodus away from Windows it would pressure them to do something

## Statistics

Currently, Windows controls about 70% of the desktop operating system market share. [Link](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/2024). Apple controls about 15% and Linux controls only 4.1%. This is even worse when looking at [Steam percentages](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/). Steam users are 95% Windows and this is somehow actually growing apparently

While Microsoft has this monopoly on the market nothing will ever change and will likely only get worse

## The Plan

My Plan is to build a team of highly focus engineers, willing to work on and develop a strong linux ecosystem to push enough people away from windows. This could be with small efforts such as:

- working on [GIMP](https://github.com/GNOME/gimp)
- Working on [Wine](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine), [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton)
- Creating new Open Source Software to rival Windows counterpart

## Why do people stay with Windows

My belief is that a large portion of developers, gamers and creative professionals are on the edge of transitioning to Linux or Mac. They are simply holding onto Windows by a single thread

For developers, its Visual Studio and C++ / C# / .NET development workflows. I also think a lot of developers are gamers and that leads me onto my next point

For gamers its, games that aren't supported on linux: Tarkov (Thats what is keeping me), Valorant, Apex, League of Legends

For creatives its, Adobe Suite, AutoCAD, Revit and Solidworks. Wacom and Surface driver compatability 

I also believe that if these 3 groups were supported that there would be a wave of security & privacy inded individuals would flock to linux

# Conclusion

I truely think this would be enough to move enough people to Linux. Once Microsoft beings taking a revenue hit because of it, they will be forced to implement changes to Windows that the consumers actual want. Unless we take action they will change nothing

I actually like Windows, but its currently in a very sad state

# How to Participate

Im currently looking for experienced developers to join me: https://discord.gg/SpeA8dEjSV and we can discuss
